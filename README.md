Dart Timetable
==============

A simple airport-like timetable made for the GDG Dart Flight School events.

This is a learning-by-doing project. It's the first time I'm actually using 
Dart for anything apart from the Darrrt Codelab, so pointers to best 
practices or better ways of doing things are highly appreciated.
